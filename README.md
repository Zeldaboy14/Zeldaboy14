I work on binary data of any kind, and I do data forensics for certain games (TF2, OOT/MM, Splatoon). ðŸ”Ž

I'm also a 3D modeler of 10 years as of this year, and a texture artist for 9 years.
As you've probably guess, I do Zelda64 rom hacking, and have been since December of 2013.
My current team members consists of z64me, Aria Hiro, ZuraRBX, SpicyWolf, and several others whom I work with less-frequently. ðŸŽ‰

All the stuff I do is free to fork and do whatever you'd like with it.
