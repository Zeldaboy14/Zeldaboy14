I work on binary data of any kind, and I do data forensics for certain games (TF2, OOT/MM, Splatoon). ðŸ”Ž

I'm also a 3D modeler since 2013, and a texture artist since 2014.
As you've probably guess, I do Zelda64 rom hacking, and have been since December of 2013.

All the stuff I do is free to fork and do whatever you'd like with it.
